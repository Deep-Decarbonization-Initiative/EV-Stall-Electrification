# EV-Stall-Electrification
This tool is intended for practitioners and researchers planning and studying workplace and other destination-based EV charging networks. It envisions that charging networks—their size and composition—can be designed based on 1) the site host's goals for supporting EV drivers and 2) charging needs of a workplace's commuters who regularly charge.
