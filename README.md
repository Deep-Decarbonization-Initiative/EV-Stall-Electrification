# EV-Stall-Electrification
DESCRIPTION
This tool is intended for practitioners and researchers planning and studying workplace and other destination-based EV charging networks with regular commuters.  It envisions that charging networks—their size and composition—can be designed based on 1) the site host's goals for supporting regular EV commuters and 2) the charging needs of the drivers who regularly commute and charge.  For greater detail on the model see Myers et al. (2025)—linked below.
